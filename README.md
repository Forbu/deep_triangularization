### deep_triangularization

Exploring ideas around triangularization.

This project is a test to see if we can remove the neural network symetries using triangular matrix for the linear layer instead of full weight matrices.

This test is inspire by :

- git rebasin paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04836)

- Exploring Weight Symmetry in Deep Neural Networks (https://hal.science/hal-01978633/file/S107731421930102X.pdf).


## Experiments


We will try various experiments on different datasets (tabular / image / text).
